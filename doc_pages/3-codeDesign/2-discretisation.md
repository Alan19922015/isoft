Title: Discretisation

Spatial derivatives of the variables describing the state of the ice
shelf and plume are frequently needed. Multiple approaches exist to
discretise these variables and compute their gradients (e.g.Â finite
difference, finite element, pseudospectral, etc.) and the desire was
to avoid restricting ISOFT to a particular one. To this end, the <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abstract Calculus</span> design
pattern, described by
[Rouson, Xia, and Xu (2014, Chapter 6)](../6-bibliog.html#Rouson2014),
was adopted. This design pattern attempts to resolve the disconnect
between high-level mathematical notation and the low-level
representation of data and operators in code. A hierarchy of derived
types was written representing mathematical fields of both scalar and
vector quantities, as illustrated in the UML class diagram
below. These fields overloaded all of the standard arithmetic and
intrinsic mathematical functions, as well as offering methods for
various differential operators. Calculations involving these field
types could then be written to be agnostic with regards to field
geometry or discretisation technique. In order to send field data to
external libraries of numerical methods, such as NITSOL, methods were
also provided to return them as an array of double precision values.

methods. The uniform field types implement all inherited abstract
methods, but these are not shown for reasons of space.](|media|/factual_classes.png)

Properties such as geometry and discretisation are specified within
the concrete implementations of the field types. As shown in the class
diagram above, two groups of these concrete field types exist. The
first is the `cheb1d_scalar_field`/`cheb1d_vector_field`, which offers
a 1-D field on a Chebyshev grid. The Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method,
described XXXXXXX, is used to calculate derivatives, with Fast Fourier
Transforms performed using the FFTW3 library
[(Frigo and Johnson, 2005)](../6-bibliog.html#Frigo2005). These were
subtypes of the abstract classes
`array_scalar_field`/`array_vector_field`. The `array` field types
provide standard implementations of arithmetic and mathematical
functions, leaving only those methods involving grid-layout or
calculus to be implemented by concrete type-descendents. This allows
easier creation of new field types with reduced code duplication. The
other pair of concrete field types are
`uniform_scalar_field`/`uniform_vector_field` which, as the names
suggest, are uniform throughout all space. These were written to allow
some optimisation for cases where a variable proves to be uniform.

The hope was that ISOFT could remain agnostic about which concrete
type of field is being used. However, bugs in the version of the
`gfortran` compiler used (v6.2.0) made this impossible and in many
situations the `cheb1d` implementations are explicitly specified. As a
result of this (and some lazy code design) ISOFT has come to depend on
using those particular implementations in a number of areas,
particularly around preconditioning (discussed in the
[Nonlinear Solvers](./3-solvers.html) section). However, relatively
minor refactoring should allow this issue to be resolved in future.

Despite the conceptual elegance of the <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abstract Calculus</span> design, a
number of practical issues mean it was likely a mistake to use it so
extensively within ISOFT. First is the problem of compiler bugs,
mentioned earlier. One of these resulted in memory leaks when a
dynamically-allocated field object was returned from a function
call. A workaround using an <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Object Pool</span> was ultimately
found. The <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Object Pool</span>
pattern passes pointers to preallocated objects, rather than creating
new ones, and releases them back to the pool once they are no longer
being used
[Grand (2002, Chapter 5)](../6-bibliog.html#Grand2002). This avoided
memory leaks but required frequent calls to book-keeping functions
which ensured objects were released to the pool at the appropriate
time. These calls eliminated much of the elegance of <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abstract
Calculus</span>. Furthermore, overloading the arithmetic operators
introduced overhead and likely prevented the compiler from making many
optimisations. With hindsight, a better approach would have been to
store the data in standard Fortran arrays and have calculus functions
provided by a set of derived types according to the <span
style="font-variant:small-caps;">Strategy</span> pattern (discussed in
the
[Parameterisations and Boundary Conditions](./parameterisations.html)
section).

However, one situation in which using the field types proved useful was
when implementing automatic differentiation
[(Neidinger 2010)](../6-bibliog.html#Neidinger2010). This works
by applying the chain rule to the arithmetic operations and elementary
mathematical functions applied to data in order to calculate the
derivative of the result with respect to one or more pieces of the data
used to produce it. The simpler of the two approaches to doing this is
to overload the arithmetic operators and elementary functions to
propagate the derivative using the chain rule.[^1] Consider ordered
pairs of the form \(\langle u, u'\rangle\), where \(u\) is some value \(u'\)
is a differential associated with that value. Then: $$\begin{aligned}
  \langle u, u' \rangle + \langle v, v' \rangle &=  \langle u + v, u'
                                                  + v' \rangle, \\
  \langle u, u' \rangle \times \langle v, v' \rangle &=  \langle uv,
                                                       u'v + uv' \rangle, \\
  \sin\langle u, u'\rangle &= \langle \sin u, u'\cos u \rangle, \\
                                                & \vdots\end{aligned}$$
with all other arithmetic and mathematical functions similarly
overloaded. As the field types already provide overloading of these
operators and routines, adding automatic differentiation required less
effort to implement than would otherwise have been necessary.

Automatic differentiation was provided as an optional feature, which the
abstract field types support but which subtypes are not required to
implement; if the feature is not implemented in a subtype then trying to
use the default implementation in the abstract class will result in a
run-time error. Methods are provided with which one field can be used to
set the derivative values for another. If the derivative for a field has
been set then it will be propagated through all subsequent mathematical
operations involving that field. Otherwise, no automatic differentiation
occurs. The derivative value of the result can be retrieved with a
getter method. Automatic differentiation is turned off with a method
which clears the derivative information. The `array` fields and their
subtypes provide automatic differentiation, but the `uniform` fields do
not.

These field types were sufficiently general that they could be used in a
number of settings other than ISOFT. As such, they were written as a
separate library called FACTUAL (Fortran Abstract Calculus Types, Usable
and Aesthetic Library). This is distributed with ISOFT but can also be
downloaded on its own.


[^1]: The other technique, known as *source transformation*,
    automatically rewrites the entire code prior to compilation so that
    propagation of the derivative is performed inline.
