ISOFT: Ice Shelf/Ocean Fluid- and Thermodynamics
================================================
ISOFT is a piece of software/suite of tools which I use to simulate the
evolution of ice shelves coupled to ocean plumes. At present it is still
in the early stages of design. Current goals are for it to provide 1D,
vertically integrated simulations for an ice shelf interacting with a
quasi-static ocean. The design was made to allow for coupling with a grounded
ice sheet in future. Other work may involve higher-dimensional models and/or
a fully dynamic ocean.
