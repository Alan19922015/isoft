    ! A data type representing a matrix operator for the momentum
    ! components of the linear parts plume equations, with the
    ! Coriolis force. It can be useful when preconditioning a the
    ! plume solver. It is inherently 1-D in its implementation, but
    ! has a transverse velocity component.
    !
    ! This type solves the linear, coupled, differential equation 
    ! \[ \frac{d}{dx} \bm{Y} = \bm{A}\bm{Y} + \bm{F} \]
    ! where \( \bm{Y} = [U, V, U', V']^{T} \),
    ! \[ \bm{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
    ! 0         & 0        & 1 & 0 \\
    ! 0         & 0        & 0 & 1 \\
    ! 0         & \Phi/\nu & 0 & 0 \\
    ! -\Phi/\nu & 0        & 0 & 0
    ! \end{bmatrix},
    ! \]
    ! and \( \bm{F} \) is the input value to which this block is 
    ! applied in the preconditioner. \(\Phi\) is the dimensionless
    ! coriolis parameter, while \(\nu\) is the eddy viscosity.
    !
    ! The matrix \(\bm{A}\) can be diagonalised by factoring it such
    ! that \(\bm{A} = \bm{V}\bm{D}\bm{V}^{-1}\), where \(\bm{V}\) is a
    ! change of basis matrix with columns made up of the eigenvectors 
    ! of \(\bm{A}\) and \(\bm{D}\) is a diagonal matrix made up of
    ! the corresponding eigenvalues. These have the values
    ! \[ \bm{V} = \begin{bmatrix}
    ! \tfrac{1+i}{\alpha}  & \tfrac{1-i}{\alpha}  & \tfrac{-1+i}{\alpha} & \tfrac{-1-i}{\alpha} \\
    ! \tfrac{-1+i}{\alpha} & \tfrac{-1-i}{\alpha} & \tfrac{1+i}{\alpha}  & \tfrac{1-i}{\alpha}  \\
    ! -i                   & i                    & i                    & -i                   \\
    ! 1                    & 1                    & 1                    & 1
    ! \end{bmatrix},
    ! \]
    ! \[ \bm{D} = \beta\begin{bmatrix}
    ! -1-i & 0    & 0   & 0   \\
    ! 0    & -1+i &     & 0   \\
    ! 0    & 0    & 1-i & 0   \\
    ! 0    & 0    & 0   & 1+i
    ! \end{bmatrix},
    ! \]
    ! \[ \bm{V}^{-1} = \frac{1}{4}\begin{bmatrix}
    ! (1-i)\beta  & -(1+i)\beta & i  & 1 \\
    ! (1+i)\beta  & -(1-i)\beta & -i & 1 \\
    ! -(1+i)\beta & (1-i)\beta  & -i & 1 \\
    ! -(1-i)\beta & (1+i)\beta  & i  & 1
    ! \end{bmatrix},
    ! \]
    ! \[ \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{2\Phi}{\nu}}, \quad \beta = \sqrt{\frac{\Phi}{2\nu}}. \]
    ! It can be shown that the solution to the differential equation is
    ! \[ \bm{Y} = \bm{V}\left(e^{\bm{D}x}\bm{B} + 
    !    e^{\bm{D}x}\int_0^{x}e^{\bm{D}x'}\bm{V}^{-1}\bm{F}dx' \right),\]
    ! where \(\bm{B}\in\mathbb{R}^{4}\) is a vector chosen to satisfy
    ! the boundary conditions on the system. It can be found by solving a
    ! 4Ã—4 linear system.
